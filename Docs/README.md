### Instalation

clone GECS github repository
execute the make command in the cloned directory

### Description 
We developed a new approach to conduct association analysis for rare variants exhaustively in whole-genome or whole-exome data sets, by variating bins sizes and MAF tresholds.

##### Prerequisites

GECS is distributed under GPL3 license. Starting from GECS 1.1.1, it supports c++ (?) on linux systems.
This program uses the alglib c++ library.


##### Usage

The usage of gecs is very simple. Only execute the follwoing command.
gecs <~/path/to/file.param>

Keywords in the parameter file [*.param](https://github.com/ddrichel/GECS/tree/master/Docs/DATA/example_1.param) :

**BFILE** "<string>         (prefix of the plink binary file)"
**SINGLEMARKER**	<bool>		  (whether single-marker analysis should be performed instead of VB (default=0))  
**PERMUTATIONS**	<int>		   (number of permutations)
**NCT**		<int>		           ("rareness" threshold: max. number of carriers per variant)
**MAFT** <double>          (Minor allele fequency threshold for rare variants)
**PTHRESHOLD**	<double>		  (max. nominal p-value for bins to be written to output files)
**ALLBINS**		<bool>		      (whether locally not-distinct bins should be written to output (useful for plotting, default=0))
**OR**		<bool>		           (Whether odd ratios will be calculated)
**CORRECTED_P** <bool>     (Whether calculated p values will be corrected by wilson score interval of CI 95%) 
**OUTPUT**		<string> 		    (Prefix of output files)

### Components

The default feature of GECS is to conduct the exhaustive collapsing scan for association (SINGLEMARKER==0).
If SINGLEMARKER==1, then GECS will conduct only the single-marker test on all variants included in the analysis.
-NOTICE- that in case of SINGLEMARKER==1, MAFT will be set to the maximum and the NCT and ALLBINS parameters will be ignored.
Input and output string parameter are to cpecify only the name of input and output file without any extensions.

#### Sigle_Marker_Analysis
In the default case (SINGLEMARKER==0) the parameters NCT and MAFT do the same job, which determinig the rareness threshold for the analysis.

#### Variable_Binning
-NOTICE- that sypecifying NCT will overwrite the parameter MAFT, otherwise, specifying only MAFT will be enough.
ALLBINS paremeter is set to 0 for the default case, where only distinct bins will be considered. This feature is only usefull in case of scanning small regions for plotting purposes.

For all cases, permutations will be used to make correction for multiple testing. That means if PERMUTATIONS==0, then there is no correction for multiple testing will be done.

You have the option to calcutae the odds ratios for all bins by specifying OR==1. (OR=0 is by default)
Resulted files

Depends on the aim of analysis. if SINGLEMARKER==1, then the text file *Singlemarker.txt will be generated, which includes the results of association tests.
If SINGLEMARKER==0, then the text file *VB.txt will be generated, which includes the results of the exhaustive scan for association.
Additionally, two files will be always generated, namely *.pvals and *srt.pvals for the correction of multiple testing.
-NOTICE- the final corrected alpha will be reported with other informations about the analysis in the *.log file.
