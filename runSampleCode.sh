# This bash script apply GECS on the example data set provided in GECS/Docs/DATA in binary plink format:

# Input files for GECS are binary plink formats, i.e. *.bed, *.bim, and *.fam.
# Input parameters and Output file name has to specified in the paremeter file (*.sfile):
#
# In addition to the input and output file names, basic parameters have to be specified:
 
# For SINGLEMARKER = 1 (The case of conducting the standard single-marker test ONLY):
# The file *singlemarker.txt will be generated, which includes the results of association tests.

# For SINGLEMARKER = 0 (The case of conducting GECS with variable binning ONLY):
# The parameter MAFT or NCT have to be specified. If both parameters were specified, then MAFT will be ignored.
# The file *_gecs_nct_*.txt will be generated, which includes the results of the exhaustive scan for association.

# In both cases, two additional files will be generated, namely *.pvals and *.srt_pvals, and include the the results of the correction for multiple testing.
#

# Uncomment one of the following lines and then execute the bash file
# Use for that the command "bash runSampleCode.sh"
